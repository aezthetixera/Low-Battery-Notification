# Low-Battery-Notification
This will create toast notifications on Windows 10 when:
  1. Your battery percentage is 80% or higher and the device is on charge.
  2. Your battery percentage is 20% or lower and the charger is not connected.

All you need to do for a start is to download this repository.zip to your local machine, unpack it and start "Battery Notification.exe"


If you want to add this app to run automatically at startup in Windows 10:
  1.Select the Start  button and scroll to find the app you want to run at startup.

  2.Right-click the app, select More, and then select Open file location. This opens the location where the shortcut to the app is saved. 

  3.With the file location open, press the Windows logo key  + R, type shell:startup, then select OK. This opens the Startup folder.

  4.Copy and paste the shortcut to the app from the file location to the Startup folder.

     (To cut long story short: just copy the shortcut of .exe file and paste it to the shell:startup)
